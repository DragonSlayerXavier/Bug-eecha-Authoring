1.  The function name should be a single word. 
2.  Please ensure that the function body for all executable functions only includes the function body. (i.e. no function signature) 
    Please note that this includes the validation function, correct function, and all incorrect functions. 
3.  Please make sure that the functions return values instead of printing them or using console.log. 
4.  Please make sure that the function body is valid JavaScript code. 
5.  For the display code (the Solution field), you may use whatever language you are using in your course. 
    (You may use pseudocode. This code does not need to be executable) 
6.  Please use line breaks to break lines in the display code. This will be translated to \ in the JSON. 
    (There is no need to do this manually) 
7.  Please use \\t to denote a tab in the display code. 
    One \\t denotes one level of indentation. Please use as many of them as needed before each line. 
8.  The question text supports markdown. You can use bold, italic, strikethrough, inline code and links. 
    Surround text in asterisks to make it *italic*, double asterisks to make it **bold**, double tildes to make it ~~strikethrough~~, backticks to make it `inline code`,  and square brackets to make it a [link text](link address). 
9.  If you would like asterisks to show up, please put a backslash before them (\\*). 
10. The markdown supports ordered and unordered lists. 
    To make an ordered list, start each line with a number followed by a period. Please make sure that the first line of the list starts with a double space and that the line preceding the list ends in a double space. 
    To make an unordered list, start each line with a dash. Please make sure that the first line of the list starts with a double space and that the line preceding the list ends in a double space. 
    Please note that ordered lists may only start from 1. in every instance.
